To make a web api project you just go into 
VIsual studio and right click on the solution
and add a new project.
The project is one that ends in web api 

If you click on the project and go into the 
CSPROJ file you will see a package reference for something called Swashbuckle
which letsd us explore the API without having a front end (we have angular but
that's not relevant)
It has a tool called Swagger to test APIs.

Now run the API project on the top

It will now open up Swagger and the title will be the name of the 
project.
You will see the UI pop up on localhost 5066 which is our case

Now we need to add a controller to set up the endpoints and coverage
for the types of HTTP requests

To do this we just right click on the controllers folder in the API project and
add "Controller"

In that new window we go to the API tab and press on the last option that
is an API controller with actions using the Entity Framework

Then you select the model class, endpoints class and data context

Now if you go back to swagger you will notice that the Shows end point is ready
and you can do all the opertaions you want.
Also notice that in the controller the methodssave changes ASYNCHRONOUSLY
as well as other operations. That is because we do not want to block the UI while we
wait for the response

Now we just need to add services for the DB Context with SqlServer in program or startup.cs
we need to configure services in program class using dependency injection so we will 
inject a service (controller, swaggerGen, ...)
