TO connect the API to the UI:

1. We need the link to the API locally.
You can find this by going into the API project, running it
and seeing what is the port in which SWAGGER ui is rendered.
In our case that is localhost:5066

2. Now go into the UI side and create a folder in the 
src folder called environments.

3.Make two files: environment.ts
and environment.prod.ts

4.Now go into the API side and set the connection
string to the Database
localhost, Database="AnimeScheduler"
