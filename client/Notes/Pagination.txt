Pagination
When we want to display a certain number of items
or rows from a table on a page. Mainly used if we have a 
lot of pages and want to view them in groups of X items.
total number of items being paged - total row number
number of items per page is key


There is normally a dropdown with page sizes for us to choose
options for that is in the "pageSizeOptions" element.

We can do this with the material angular io paginator here:
